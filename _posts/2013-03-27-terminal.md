Check whether your terminal supports 256 colors,

```bash
tput colors
```

You can check available terminal database under /lib/terminfo/ sub-directory.
If you could find a database file suffixed with `256color`, then you can use
them to set the `TERM` environment variable. Most of the terminal application
will be using this variable to setup its color scheme. Now add the following
line in your shell's `rc` file, eg., $HOME/.zshrc

```bash
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

If you are an [zsh][zsh-link] user, then you have to setup keyboard mapping
for the terminal as well. You can choose to ignore this short cut and redo
the mapping manually when you start the zsh shell next time.

```bash
cd ~/.zkbd
cp xterm-pc-linux-gnu xterm-256color-pc-linux-gnu
```

Setup color scheme for Vim
--------------------------

There are many good schemes available for vim. Download / checkout links are
available from bottom of this section, download and copy them to your
`$HOME/.vim/colors/` directory and add the following line in `$HOME/.vimrc`
file,

```vim
color jellybeans
```

Inside Vim, you can change the colors on the fly by doing:

```vim
:color solarized
```

[solarized][solarized-link], [jellybeans][jellybeans-link], ir_black,
[hemisu][hemisu-link] are some good color schemes, there is also a
[collection of themes][themes] available from github.

Configuring readline
--------------------

Most terminal applications that does not require full-screen rendering will be
using the readline library to control the terminal output. To interact with
such applications using vim or Emacs key-binding, there is a global
configuration for that.

**Agency**: "Sir, we found 3 candidates as per your requirements. How do you want their  placements, sir?"

**MD**: "Put about 100 bricks in a closed room. Then send the candidates into the room and close the door, leave them alone and come back after a few hours and analyse the situation:

1. If they are counting the bricks, put them in `Accounts` department.
2. If they are recounting the bricks, put them in `Auditing`.
3. If they messed up the whole room with the bricks, put them in `Engineering`.
4. If they are arranging the bricks in some strange order, put them in `Planning`.
5. If they are throwing the bricks at each other, put them in `Operations`.
6. If they are sleeping, put them in `Security`.
7. If they broke the bricks into pieces, put them in `Information Technology`.
8. If they are sitting idle, put them in `Human Resources`.
9. If they say they have tried different combinations yet not a single brick has been moved, put them in `Sales`.
10. If they have already left for the day, Put them in `Marketing`.
11. If they are staring out of the window, put them in `Strategic Planning`.

And...

If they are talking to each other and not a single brick has been touched, Congratulate them and put them in `Top Management`."

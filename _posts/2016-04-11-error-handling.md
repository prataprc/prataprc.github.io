**Golang** says, multi value returns or
[panic/recover](http://blog.golang.org/error-handling-and-go)

Like most _practical_ languages they simply short-circuit
the execution path. Of course it will come back to bite us
if side-effects are not adequately taken care. And multi-value
return as an after-thought ?

**Erlang** says, [let it crash](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LetItCrash)

Because the number of variables and assumptions are
so high that we will never ship if we had to get into
every last detail.

**Rust** says, be it authoring an OS or authoring a log-parser
error handling shall not interfere with code
composability - [rust-doc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/error-handling.html)

If types are aligned then functions are composable, and
they say algebraic-data-types is a clean solution rather
than multi-value returns, but their error handling seem
to be an ongoing story ?

**Haskell** says, exception make a function impure, and
un-handled exception is an error -
[Haskell's exception](https://wiki.haskell.org/Exception)

It takes a thesis in category theory and a monadic
implementation to handle exceptions, after which
every thing that follow becomes pure, and
leaves rest of the programming world
scratching its head â€¦

Asserts, exceptions and error-returns - looks like
sharpest minds in our industry are still deciphering
a clean way out.

IMHO given such a loaded situation if programmer handles
exceptions and errors bad-ly is he/she the only person
to blame ? After all, if the language is in-adequate why
blame the speakers.

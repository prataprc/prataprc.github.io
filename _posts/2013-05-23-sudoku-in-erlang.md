For past three decades semiconductor industry promised to double the speed
of microprocessor every two years, and they did keep to their promise. Now, it
looks like they have exhausted all the available tricks and the only way to
increase computation speed is by going parallel - packing more number of cores
in the same die. But that ain't so easy, for it requires re-designing our
algorithms to run parallel. Enter concurrent programming. Erlang is one such
language that encourages concurrency.

Concurrent programming is a paradigm of writing computer programs that can
execute in parallel. Three decades of structured programming concepts
popularized by languages like C and Java have made the entire ecosystem of
computer applications optimized for sequential programming. Now, even when we
are ready to redesign our algorithms for concurrency, its implementation,
testing and deployment are making life difficult for us. The general focus on
Erlang here is that it may save us from some of those difficulties. Let us
experiment couple of scenarios using [sudoku][sudoku-link]. There is a
separate [article][sudoku-pathological] describing the algorithm and why it
will make sense in this context. Source code for the same can be found in
[github][github-link]. You can find more details on the scripts that we will
using it here.

Sequential, parallel and concurrent algorithms
---------------------------------------------

**Sequential** version of the sudoku puzzle solver is implemented as a
single threaded program. An Erlang process is spawned to solve a single
puzzle, which will sequentially track and back-track empty slots filling
them with possible correct values. It took 6.3 ms to solve just one
puzzle,

```bash
# solve a single sudoku puzzle of complexity 3 (9x9) and difficulty 40%
$ bin/sudoku -c 3 -d 40 -s 1123
complexity:3 count:1 difficulty:40 seed:1123
Time taken to evaluate 6329uS
```

With above parameters to sudoku script, we generated a 9x9 puzzle, populating
40% of the slots, with complexity of 3. The `-s` option provides seed
value to the random-generator - so that same puzzles will be generated
for the same seed value. To solve 100 puzzles one after another using the
same erlang process, utilizing just one core, takes about 1.18 seconds.

```bash
# solve a single sudoku puzzle of complexity 3 (9x9) and difficulty 40%
$ bin/sudoku -c 3 -d 40 -s 1123 -n 100
complexity:3 count:100 difficulty:40 seed:1123
Time taken to evaluate 1182004uS
```
All measurements are taken with my 2GHz Core-2 Quad desktop`.

**Parallel** version of the sudoku puzzle solver spawns an erlang process
for each puzzle and there by it can utilize all the available cores. This is
not really a concurrent algorithm, but just plain vanilla parallel batch
processing utilizing multiple cores. This is similar to modern web servers
utilizing multiple cores.

**Concurrent** version of this algorithm, will spawn an erlang process for
each possible path, that is, for a given empty slot if there can be 2 possible
values, then two erlang process will be spawned and each one will assume one
of the possible values. With this algorithm, even to solve a single puzzle,
we can utilize all the available cores.

We will run the same script with few more switches, and SMP disabled.

```bash
$ bin/sudoku -c 3 -n 100 -d 40 -s 1123 -benchmark # SMP disabled
```

Above command generates 100 puzzles of complexity 3, 9x9 sudoku table,
populating 40% of the slots. Same seed value will generate same set of tables.
The script outputs five columns,

* `1st column`, no.of puzzles solved.
* `2nd column` time taken to solve them sequentially.
* `3rd column` time taken to solve puzzles parallely, one erlang-process
  for each puzzle.
* `4th column` same as 2nd column, except that concurrent version of algorithm
  is used.
* `5th column` same as 3rd column, except that concurrent version of algorithm
  is used.

`bin/sudoku` was executed in SMP disabled mode by adding the following header
in the beginning.

```erlang
#!/usr/bin/env escript
%% -*- erlang -*-
%%! -smp disable
```

Let us now plot the data with [gnuplot][gnuplot-link],

![nosmp](media/sudokucharts/nosmp.png)

Again, the script is executed with same switches but with two cores enabled.
Replace `-smp disable` with `+S 2:2` in the script header. A similar 5-column
output is generated and plotted below,

![smp2](media/sudokucharts/smp2.png)

Once again, the script is executed with 4 cores enabled, that is, using
the `+S 4:4` switch and plotted below,

![smp4](media/sudokucharts/smp4.png)

We can easily observe that,

- Whether parallel version or concurrent version, there is virtually no
  overhead introduced when utilizing multiple cores.
- Both parallel version and concurrent version can linearly scale with
  number of cores.

Parallel version is plotted on single-core, 2-core, and 4-core variants,

![par](media/sudokucharts/par.png)

We can observe that parallel version scales linearly with number of cores.

Concurrent version, when executed one after another using the same erlang
process, is plotted on single-core, 2-core, and 4-core variants,

![conc](media/sudokucharts/conc.png)

Shows that there is no improvement of using a concurrent version of the
algorithm and neither a overhead of using it.

Performance for pathological cases ?
------------------------------------

Let us apply sequential version and concurrent version of the algorithm for
a pathological sudoku combination and measure its performance on different
core-counts. A puzzle can be [pathological][sudoku-pathological] when it
leads the algorithm to backrack millions or billions of time before it end
up on the right path.

I have added two puzzle files priv/long3.term and long4.term, both having a
pathological case.

First we will solve the pathological case with sequential version,

```bash
$ bin/sudoku -f priv/long3.term         # SMP disabled
Time taken to evaluate: 3988177uS       # 3.9 Seconds
```

Then with concurrent version, on different number of cores.

```bash
$ bin/sudoku -t -f priv/long3.term      # SMP with 4 cores
Time taken to evaluate: 195572uS        # 195 milliseconds

$ bin/sudoku -t -f priv/long3.term      # SMP with 2 cores
Time taken to evaluate: 415335uS        # 415 milliseconds

$ bin/sudoku -t -f priv/long3.term      # SMP disabled
Time taken to evaluate: 1078302uS       # 1 second
```

`-t` switch enables the concurrent mode, we can see that between 4 cores and 2
cores there is 2x improvement because the concurrent logic is making use of
the extra cores. But what will surprise us is that,

**concurrent version performs 4x better even on a single-core**. And with 4
cores, performance **improves to 20x**. How does that happen ? **welcome to
swarm algorithms !!**

Swarm algorithm
---------------

A backtracking algorithm becomes a swarm algorithm when it explores as many
path as possible simultaneously, thus it avoids spending time on bad bath. In
many cases the number of steps in a backtracking algorithm is not more than
couple of hundred, and we find that, given enough execution time for the good
path it gets completed quick enough. Note that swarm algorithm does not
remove the exponential complexity of backtracking logic - but it gives a great
deal on performance.

This experiment might also teach us that concurrent programming is not just
about multiple cores.

Long ago, I wrote a similar Sudoku puzzle solver in C / Linux, but the
best part of writing it in Erlang is the way it prompted me to re-design the
algorithm for concurrency. In C, I would have never thought of spawning a
new process for every choice it makes, but here it was only natural. 

That is how a language can affect our creativity, be it for programming or for
poetry. And it is those simple and unassuming things that changes one's
perspective.

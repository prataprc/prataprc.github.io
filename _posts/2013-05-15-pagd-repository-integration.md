Read this [article](./blog-with-pagd.html) to know how to set up your blog
site with [pagd][pagd-link] and host it using [github][github-link]. Continue
reading if you are managing your site under a revision control system like
git / mercurial.

In case you are managing your site with git or mercurial repository, your can
integrate them with pagd so that while generating the site pagd can gather
useful, and some times more accurate meta-data, for each page from the
repository. Just open the `_context.json` file under your site's
`_contents` sub-directory and add the following context attribute

```json
{ "_xcontext" : "pagd.git" }
```

Note that context attributes defined with `_contents/_context.json` file is
applicable to all page contents created under `_contents` sub-directory.

If you want to integrate with mercurial repository, rename `pagd.git` to
`page.hg`. From `pagd`'s perspective, we are integrating git / mercurial
repository with your site using a feature called external-context.
`pagd.git` and `page.hg` are plugin names that will gather context information
from external sources. As of this writing, these plugins will gather the
following information for each page,

- author
- email
- createdon
- last_modified

There is an important caveat in this. If you are relying on repository meta
data for `last_modified` attribute, then you will have to do it like this,

- create / update your blog articles.
- once done, add them to your repository and make sure to commit the same.
- then run `pagd gen`.

Even if you have executed `pagd gen` command before, you must make sure that
you regenerate your modified pages after they are committed into the
repository. Otherwise, last_modified date will not be accurate.

You can then add the generated html pages, commit them and push them to
github, or else-where.

In 1947 Aug 15, a party began, to celebrate something that was vaguely similar
to Independence. In 1960s a bunch of people decide to spoil the party. They did
every thing to that end and till today they are moving around the country in
different forms. I never understood their purpose. They don't seem to be
fighting for the proletarian either, although, sometimes they camouflage into
that ideal. They spoil the party, where ever it is, what ever kind it is, for
every form of good-times a resistance was lurking around, people always shored
up on the resistance. I never understood them, I even doubt they understand
them self.  But then that seem to be their very fate - "eternal struggle" !! It
is a human spirit, eternal struggle is a human spirit and succumbing to that
is as natural as breathing air.

Disgusted with status quo is just the first step. Many who dare to take
the first step, retire after that ...

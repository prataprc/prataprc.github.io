Thought of doing a word play here, mashing up the 3 words, and its 3
statements, of Reinhold Niebuhr:

    "Nothing worth doing is completed in our lifetime,
        therefore we must be saved by HOPE.
    Nothing true or beautiful makes complete sense in
    any immediate context of history,
        therefore we must be saved by FAITH.
    Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone,
        therefore, we are saved by LOVE."
                                            -- Reinhold Niebuhr

Becomes,

    Anything that is worth doing, ought to be true and beautiful.
    If indeed one finds truth and beauty, when found alone,
    remains incomplete. So, GOD preached LOVE, and, for men to have
    FAITH on his preaching, He gave them HOPE.
    But before Him, there was a beautiful She, who could beget the
    ultimate truth in return for faithful-love. She is still here,
    watching over the endless variations of faith, love and hope.

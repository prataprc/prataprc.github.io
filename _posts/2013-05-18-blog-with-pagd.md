First time I started blogging it was with [blogspot][blogspot-link], which
was too cumbersome to me and eventually lost interest. Second time around,
I started by listing down my requirements,

- maintain my articles in a repository so that I can work with them as I
  move around.
- by committing to the repository, my article gets published.
- basic features like, wiki-style markup, code highlighting, referring to
  image URL, etc are important.
- customizable layouts and templates.

And found that github can address some of those. It can host static sites for
me - even plain old HTML files, and [pagd][pagd-link] filled up the remaining
requirements. Please note that techniques explained here are suitable for
folks who are using a Linux distribution or Mac OS-X and comfortable with shell
interface.

How do I setup my blog site ?
-----------------------------

It is easy, create a virtual environment, install `pagd`, and use
`pagd.myblog` plugin to create a site layout. Let us go one step at a time,

First get Python-3.x for your distribution, Pagd works only with Python-3. In
case of mac, you can use `brew install python3` to get the latest Python-3.x
version.

Second, setup a virtual environment to install Pagd and its dependencies. The
following example assumes Python-3.2 as your python version. You can change it
to Python-3.3 or later based on your machine's python version.

```bash
# To install on ubuntu
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools     # Install python3-setuptools
sudo easy_install3 pip          # will give you the command pip-3.2
sudo pip-3.2 install virtualenv

# To install on mac-osx,
brew install python3    # automatically installs pip and setuptools
pip install --upgrade setuptools pip
pip install --upgrade virtualenv
```

I hope that in coming future Linux distributions will have python-3.x by
default and comes with `pip` pre-installed, in which case executing
`sudo pip install virtualenv` should suffice. Let us now create a virtual
environment to play with `pagd`.

```bash
$ virtualenv --python=python3.2 env     # env/ will be created under `pwd`
$ source env/bin/activate       # enter the virtual environment
(env)$ pip install pagd
```

The example suggests Python-3.2, but you can use any later Python-3 version.
Installing [pagd][pagd-link] package will provide you `pagd` command line
script and as long as you are inside virtual environment the command will
be available via `$PATH`.

**creating my blog layout**

One of the first thing that we do when using `pagd`is to create a layout,
in this case a layout implemented by `pagd.myblog` plugin. The name of the
plugin is `myblog` which comes pre-packaged with Pagd, hence we address it as
`pagd.myblog`.

```bash
(env)$ pagd create
```

A layout is created under the current working tree, so make sure to change to
an appropriate path under your home-directory before executing the above
command. And executing the above command will create a bunch of files and
directories for you.

```text
+- config.json
+- _contents/
+- media/
+- _templates/
```

To start with, you don't have to bother about `_templates/` and `media/`
directories. Just add your articles under `_contents/` directory in one of
the supported formats - which are extensible by plugins - and as of
this writing,  plain-text, ReStructured-text, markdown and html formats are
supported. Keep a tab on [pagd][pagd-link] project site to know what else is
getting added.

Make sure that your `_contents/` directory have a file by name index.<format>
which will be converted to `index.html` while generating the site.
`index.html` will be the main page for your web site.

Once you have your articles, generate the site.

```bash
(env)$ pagd gen
```

This will generate the web site, translating your contents into html pages.
Above command must be executed under the root-directory of your layout and
unless `-t` switch, specifying a target directory, is passed via command
line, index.html and all the other pages will be placed relative to your
layout's root-directory.

You can do `pagd gen --help` to learn available options.

Add to github and publish your site
-----------------------------------

Github has certain [conventions](http://pages.github.com/) on hosting a
repository as personal blog site. Since that could change in future, I am not
going to explain them here, may be in a separate post.

Once you have your repository setup in github, like in my case
`prataprc.github.io`, you can start adding your files into the repository
and commit them after every modifications.

Make sure that you run `pagd gen` command before adding / committing files
into your github repository.

To keep a tab on [pagd][pagd-link] - follow [project at github][pagd-gh-link]
and post your queries to their [mailing-list][mailing-link].
